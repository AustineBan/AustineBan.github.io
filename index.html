                    This project is a deeply inspired and stringently guided world peace initiative master-plan and global freedom from anarchy in the human society, an immediate to holocaust of incessant perilous wars and mental savagery-oriented ideological framework, telepathically impacted and gently communicated to me from the spirit world, right in the ashrama (sacred home) of the founder Acharya of the International society for Krishna Consciousness Worldwide, many times during some of my exceptionally serene and peaceful early morning Japa meditation exercise to be precise; in the person of His Divine Grace- A .C Bhaktivedanta Swami Srila Prahbupada. 

The unusual settings and aggregates of this missionary horizon, and the formation of this great foundation were never the results of any personal whims or caprices, but the real outcome of a genuine course of an intense spiritual passion and unprovoked quest for selfless devotional services unto the Lordships and humanity at large, by the empowerment and special grace of the Supreme Godhead Himself. 

Based on the strength and conviction of this spiritual truth; calling and empowerment, the humble servants in this organization therefore, does not reserve any claim of authority or power of proprietorship over the constitution and formation of this great renaissance movement of its kind. Under this strong faith we therefore boldly invites the confidence and trust of the general public to accept in totality all of the creeds and norms as an exceptionally divine packages and unusual spiritual roadmap of no human mental concoction to freedom from all earthly miseries due to human ignorant of self and gross contamination from his material life, hence every facets of this world peace mission initiatives and humanitarian projects remains the right dictation from above –whilst this written guidebook of documents and composite spiritual directory simply represents the personal instruction and direction of this great icon, this unusual personality and spiritual master of our millennium; His Divine Grace A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Srila Prahbupada.

                        <p>Sankirtan movement in the African continent over the years has never witnessed the most expected result due to several factors such as mass illiteracy, lack of tactical and strategic approach in preaching. This finding is garnered from research and careful observation over the years. THE AFRICAN HARE KRISHNA AFRICAN DIGITAL SATELLITE CABLE TELEVISION NETWORK SERVICE INTERNATIONAL shall be effectively used for the preaching and propagation of Krishna Consciousness to everyone around the globe, the local upper-class African audience in particular.
                            From close observation, the traditional sankirtan method used here in Africa has been directed mainly towards people in the streets and motor parks. The uneducated street hawkers and touts are our permanent sympathizers. The sankirtan movement is yet to find effective methods for preaching to civil servants, academics, celebrities, business moguls, industrialists, politicians and the traditional rulers in our countries among other numerous interesting and highly educative and enlightenment packages in the proposal.

                        <h6>6. SRILA PRAHBUPADA SPIRITUAL ACADEMY AND AFRICAN CHILD MASS LITERACY AGENCY INTERNATIONAL</h6>
                        <p>Tell me the nation without youths and I will tell you the nature and fate of such a great empire without future. This practical ideology must be thoroughly observed and carefully applied in-ISKCON-worldwide and the African continent in particular without any further delay. For the great future of-ISKCON- anywhere in the world, the youths must be heavily invested upon and adequately funded and encouraged without any iota of restriction or reservation. In the actual course of this sublime truth, early stage child training can never be over-emphasized, inasmuch the statement that says, “Train up a child in the way he should go, and when he is old he/she will never depart from it”(Proverbs 22: 6).This is exactly the vision and the mission of “THE SRILA PRAHBUPADASPIRITUAL ACADEMY AND AFRICAN CHILD MASS LITERACY CAMPAIGN AGENCY.
                            Of course, early child training is one and very important responsibility, but another indisputable factor remains the spiritual foundation, where the soul-existence of the human society completely lies in earnest.
                            There are so many early-child training centers around the globe, but we are yet to witness the expected level of discipline and serenity in our society. Undoubtedly, the reason for this ugly situation as mentioned above is simply due to lack of organizational spiritual foundation and settings, which is paramount and wholly determines in practical terms, the psychological state and general spiritual consciousness of the people, put together. To tackle this menace headlong, THE SRILA  PRAHBUPADA SPIRITUAL ACADEMY AND AFRICAN CHILD MASS LITERACY CAMPAIGN ORGANIZATION has come to  rehabilitate all the dilapidated ISKCON Gurukula Vedic traditionally-based school system in the African continent, because such first-class educational system will transform the human society for the best and also bear the good fruit of the future-ISKCON-spiritual masters of different races. 
                            The Supreme Lord says in Bhagavad Gita 9:2, “This knowledge is the king of education, the most secret of all secrets. It is the purest knowledge, and because it gives direct perception of self by realization and it is the perfection of religion. It is everlasting, and it is joyfully performed.”
                            Unfortunately, the world governments do not have such an accredited spiritually life transforming universities anywhere in entire globe. This is our present challenge, and this times our great priority. So, as brahmins and Krishna representatives in the human society, this organization has decided to take up this transcendental responsibility in comparison, to establish a very challenging visible demarcation between the impact of the timeless Vedic cultural civilization, and the world-class pseudo-scientific development and civilization, through the yardstick of the Srila Prahbupada African Gurukula Vedic school project.

It shall engage capable and talented African devotees and other enthusiasts in meaningful devotional service by massive book distribution in the continent. The organization in partnership with the BBT Africa shall translate Srila Prahbupada’s transcendental literatures into many African local languages, for easy and wider Sankritan movement.
                            This organization shall produce an African version of the BACK TO GODHEAD MAGAZINE, which would be more effective for the African Harinama Sankirtan mission for Krishna Consciousness. It shall print and publish locally, preaching materials and books written by-ISKCON- devotees, vice- versa.

The organization shall use modern tropical farms, agriculture and food sufficiency programs to lobby, influence, and penetrate world leaders and governments at all levels with the mission of Lord Sri Caitanya Mahaprahbu.

                            Therefore, this agency according to Prahbupada’s instruction is going to embark on a large-scale tropical farming, and massive agricultural produce and infrastructures; a strong campaign for food sufficiency and mass nutrition programs for the African children. 
                            To achieve the two-parallel objectives of the Prahbupada led African sankritan organization together in the mood of high spirit of service and enthusiasm; the movement shall partner with other relevant agencies and reputable consultant firms in agriculture for the highly anticipated best results.
