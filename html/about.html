                <h5>The Meaning of our lady's wailing house</h5>
                <p>
                    BY “OUR LADY” we mean the Blessed Virgin Mary, mother of Jesus Christ and the mother of the church. To wail is to make a long loud high cry because one is sad or in pain. “Wailing house” is a house where such cry is made continuously.
                    Our lady’s wailing house is therefore a crying house belonging  to the Blessed Virgin Mary, where her children gather to cry to the Blessed Trinity and to her to save us from the calamities that have befallen and is about to befall the world. The world is wallowing obstinately in sin and is at the verge of total destruction. The children of Mary recall what happened in the book of ESTHER, when the people of Israel were facing total annihilation and they cry with Esther the queen to God and obtained salvation. Our lady’s wailing house is a house where we beckon on Mary the Queen of heaven and earth to join her voice with ours and call down the mercy of God. It is a house where we like the baby Jesus sit at the foot of Mary and listen to her maternal admonition and emulate her virtues. It is a house where we do reparation for the sorrow and anguish our sins and that of the world have caused Blessed Virgin Mary and God himself.
