                <h2>BIOGRAPHY OF THE FOUNDER; THE -SRILA PRAHBUPADA FOUNDATION FOR WORLD PEACE INITIATIVES INTERNATIONAL (SPFWPII)</h2>
                <p>This short note as a highlight is however, intended to give elaborate insight and deeper understanding about the origin, mission and purpose of this charismatic organization mentioned here above.
                    Born on September 2, 1970, in Onoli Vllage, Awgu local government Area, Enugu State Nigeria, West Africa. An upper middle class family of Mr. Nwankwo Nkwo-odine and Mrs. Lucia Nwankwo, as successful farmers by occupation and ardent traditionalist by religion until death in 1973, except his wife who was converted in a Christian almost at old age, before her demise also in 1998, respectively.
                    Before his bachelor’s degree award in pharmacy (BS Pharm) -the University of Nigeria Nsukka, in 1988, Bhakta Nwankwo Shedrack was honored the best literature and science student at the Boy’s Secondary School, Awgu, by the Enugu State Education management board, where he went for his secondary school education.
                    On the path of the underlying spiritual evolution which has horribly tossed him almost round the whole mystic school of thoughts of both ancient and circular origins, Bhakta Nwankwo Shedrack later found this path of devotional service (bhakti yoga) under the mystical influence of spiritual navigation, special arrangement of the Lords and sudden contact with the International Society for Krishna Consciousness worldwide (ISKCON) in 2006, with His Divine Grace A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Srila Prahbupada as the Diksha Guru and leader of the religious organization. 
                    Since this contact, Bhakta Shedrack has been observing all the regulative principles according to the spiritual tenets of the movement, highly worshiped and diligently following in the footsteps of this great Acharya, (spiritual warrior) vice visa, from whence this inspiration and vision emanated and telepathically impacted and expounded to me; an aspiring devotee of Lord Sri Krishna and great Mother Radhika under –HH. Bbakti -Dhira Damodara Swami Maharaj (Bdds).
                    A -conference speaker on Vedic culture and philosophy. A prolific writer and pragmatic playwright. A movie director, researcher and religious teacher of a no mean order.

                <h2>HIS DIVINE GRACE SRILA -PRAHBUPADA</h2>
                <p>Srila Prahbupada is the Founder Acharya of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON) which brought a great spiritual dimension to the lives of thousands of his followers worldwide. He was a rare personality who appeared on the earth and dedicated his life to spreading God consciousness all over the world.
                    The scriptures recommends the chanting of the holy name of the Supreme Lord Krishna known as the (Harinama sankirtan) as the devotional practice best suited for the present age for spiritual emancipation and perfection. Lord Sri Caitanya Mahaprahbu (God’s incarnate) –who appeared over 500 years ago in Western Bengal, India, was the greatest exponent of this method. He predicted that His message will be carried to every town and villages of this world by a powerful spiritual ambassador. The life and activities of Srila Prahbupada has therefore proved beyond every doubt that he is the empowered personality who appeared to fulfill this prediction.
                    When His Divine Grace A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Srila Prahbupada entered the port of New York City on September 17, 1965; few Americans took notice –but he was not merely another immigrant. He was on a mission to introduce the ancient teachings of Vedic India into mainstream America. Before Srila Prahbupada passed away on November 14, 1977 at the age of 81, his mission proved successful. He had founded the International Society for Krishna Consciousness, popularly known as (ISKCON) and saw it grow into a worldwide confederation of more than 100 temples, ashrams (sacred homes) and cultural centers across the world.

                <h2>EARLY LIFE </h2>
                <p>Bhaktivedanta Srila Prahbupada was born Abbay Charan De on September 1, 1896 to a pious Hindu family in Calcutta (now Kolkata) India. He was also called Nandulal. His father was Gour Mohan De, who worked as a cloth merchant, and his mother was Rajani De. Consistent with Bengali traditions, Abbay charan’s parents invited an astrologer to predict his horoscope. The astrologer subsequently professed to De’s family that later in his life, Abbay would become a” great exponent of religion.” Abbay, however, grew up in a Vaishanav home (pious Hindu family) and his father was an ardent devotee in his spiritual faith and practices. Gour Mohan on regular basis took Abbay to the Radha- Govinda temple as a child. Later in life, Srila Prahbupada fondly remembers the murtis (architectural and paraphernalia outfit) of that temple. 
                    During his first year, his family arranged for his marriage with Radharani Datta. Until completing his fourth year in the College, Abbay lived with his family and Radharani lived with hers. In 1920, Abbay chose not to accept his graduation diploma, and as a youth growing up in the British controlled India, he became involved with Mahatma Gandhi’s civil disobedience movement to secure independent for his nation. -And while working at a small pharmaceutical business in 1922, he met and became a disciple of a prominent scholar and spiritual master; Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati (1874-1937), which significantly proved most influential on Abbay’s future life, ordination and calling. 
                    Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati, was a leader in the Gaudiya Vaishnava denomination, a monotheistic tradition within the broad Hindu culture, and asked Abbay Charan Aravinda Nandulal to bring the teachings of Lord Sri Krishna to the English –speaking world after his initiation into the faith from the same in Allahabad, in 1933; where he finally resolved to carry out his mentor’s instruction which later awarded him the honorific names as; A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Srila Prahbupada, who later spent the next 32 years preparing for the great missionary journey to the western.

                <h2>SPIRITUALITY</h2>
                <p>In 1944, A. C. Bhaktivedanta Srila prahbupada started the publication called ‘Back to Godhead Magazine’ for which he was the writer, designer, publisher, editor and distributor all together. His spiritual master, Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati, instructed him to spread the message of the supreme Lord Sri Caitanya Mhaprahbu (Gods incarnate) in the English language for the English speaking nations of the world. In 1947, the Gaudiya Vaishnava Society gave him the title Bhaktivedanta (Bhakti-vedanta). In the 1960s, after founding the International Society for Krishna Consciousness ISKCON became known by the honorific Prahbupada.
                    From 1950 onwards, he lived at the medieval Radha-Damodar mandir in the holy town of Vridavan, where he began his commentary and translation work of the Sanskrit work –the Bhagavata Purana. His Guru, Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati, had always encouraged him to publish books, referring to the need for the literary presentation of the Vaishnava culture.

                <h2>MISSION TO THE WESTERN WORLD</h2>
                <p>In 1965, at the age of sixty –nine, Srila Prahbupada travelled to New York City aboard a cargo ship. The journey was treacherous, and the elderly spiritual teacher suffered two heart attacks aboard ship. Arriving in the United Sates with just seven US dollars in Indian rupees and his translations of sacred Sanskrit texts, Srila Prahbupada began to share the timeless wisdom of Krishna consciousness. His message of peace and goodwill resonated with many young people, some of whom came forward to become serious students of the Krishna tradition. With the help of these students, Srila Prahbupada rented a small storefront on New York’s Lower East Side to use as a temple. On July 11, 1966, he officially registered his organization in the state of New York, formally founding the International Society of Krishna Consciousness.
                    In the eleven years that followed, Srila Prahbupada circled the entire globe fourteen times on lecture tours, bringing the teachings of Lord Sri Krishna to thousands of people on six continents. Men and women from all backgrounds and walks of life came forward to accept his divine message, and with their help, Srila Prahbupada established ISKCON centers and projects throughout the world – the same and exact mission and spiritual objective of this present movement, in the form and style of a commissioned global peace initiatives and charity organization.
                    Under his inspiration as same as our proposals represents, Krishna devotees established temples, rural communities, educational institutions, and started what would become the world’s largest vegetarian food relief programs, etc. With the desire to nourish the roots of Krishna Consciousness in its home, Srila Prahbupada returned to India several times, where he sparked a revival in the Vaishnava tradition. In India, he opened dozens of temples, including large centers in the holy towns of Vrindavan and Mayapur.

                <h2>GREATEST ACHIEVEMENTS</h2>
                <p>Srila Prahbupada significant contributions, perhaps, are his many books. He authored over seventy volumes on the Krishna tradition, which are highly respected by scholars for their authority, depth, fidelity to the tradition, and clarity. Several of his works are being used as textbooks in numerous college courses. His writings have been translated into 76 languages. His most prominent works includes in lists;  The Bhagavad –gita As It Is, the thirty Volume Srimad –Bhagavatam, And the 17- volume Sri Caitanya Caritamrita, to mention but very few. However, this is the exact mission and spiritual project -the –Srila Prahbupada foundation for world peace initiatives has come to give a boost and in a very significant measure help to accomplish in the human society, as the Lordships guides and empower us.
                    Haribol !!!
