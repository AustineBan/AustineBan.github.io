                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>The Srila Prahbupada Foundation For World Peace Initiatives International, is an incorporated nongovernmental organization (NGO), philosophically -deeply rooted from the ancient school of thoughts and spiritual wisdom of the timeless Vedic origins, in the form, operational system and style of a commissioned global peace missionary outreach and utter humanitarian project.
                    It is a nonprofit renaissance; social critics and activist movement with human right arbitration concern deepened in the heart, as a coalition agency and collaborator among the world team and international committee of legal aid counsels and advocates for the weak;  oppressed and the less privileged in the society. A distinguished charity organization with multidimensional humanitarian packages for the vulnerable; the sick, the elderly, the internally displaced and refugee crisis management; the handicapped, motherless children and victims of abject poverty and penury, to mention but very few.
                    Founded, paddled by the concept of divine navigation, and led by the architectural designs of the noble hands of selected erudite men, women and distinguished scholars; men of impeccable characters and unequal dedication. Great and gentle men of proven identities; immaculate spiritual wisdom, professionalism and expertise from all works of life and different rankings in academic excellence and ecclesiastical disciplines and prowess; the Srila Prahbupada World Peace Foundation International, exceptionally represents an epitome of divinity and justice to humanity on earth as a first class replica and exquisite definition of an unwavering advocacy and strong pillar for the rule of law, with our underlying world-wide crusade for a perfect and all inclusive democratic theory and ideology by action, in the human society.
                    Srila Prahbupada world Peace Foundation is purely a non-religious sectarian charity organization, but wholly and deeply founded from the strongest conviction and religious belief in the existence and supremacy of ONE Omnipotent-Omniscience Godhead, as it remains a formidable voice and co-defender of the eternal sacred order of equity, mutuality  and justice for all living beings including animals and plants at all and sundry, due to the sublime truth occasioned in the indisputable spiritual evidence of the one unbreakable esoteric lineage of the entire human progeny and genealogy -tied up in the nuptial cord of the universal principle of eternal BROTHERHOOD and agape LOVE to one another.
                    The Srila Prahbupada World Peace Foundation International, is further, a non-politically motivated entity of any kind whatsoever, but simply a pace-setter and mouth piece of the common people in a strong advocacy for capacity building and perfect policy implementation objectivity  for the human citizenry- by community oriented development projects and human capital empowerment for all genders; whilst the grassroots provision of quality healthcare delivery and mass literacy campaign through our generous scholarship scheme and programs remains our indispensible watchword. Other purpose in the list also includes active participation in world’s spiritual civilization enshrined in the maintenance of peace and harmony with our supernatural world environments by education, knowledge and total obedience to the supreme order of the cosmic manifestation, to mention but few. 
                    This organization by mission and origin is overly inclined to world peace project also as an active conflict resolution consultant firm and human right arbitration agency, heavily drawn and instigated from our rich Vedic cultural and philosophical heritage and enlightenment, underscored by the virtue and scope of our global visionary projects and grassroots humanitarian oriented activities and programs, in our eternal resolved to operate and function at all times in the name and style of the  above mentioned; the- SRILA PRAHBUPADA FOUNDATION FOR WORLD PEACE INITIATIVES INTERNATIONAL.
                    We always represent love and peace for all and sundry. We are non violent by nature and constitution, and does not either sponsor or condone any art of hostility, criminality and terrorism anywhere. And to honorably achieve and amiably upheld our great norms and policies as our golden rules in the service;  we have therefore taken it upon ourselves in a strong vow to limit the breadth and scope of our operational activities in absolute due respect within the ambit and circle of all known existing laws of the land anywhere in the world, hence our obligations and advocacy as a charity organization and world peace movement by example, which remains pre-eminence in all our activities and services to mankind devoid of any  guile or treachery of any traces absolutely. We are completely humanitarian and totally spiritual both in words and activities, as we highly advance our course and commitment, thus, only for the goodness and welfare of the human society in general. And as our doors remain open for all, we don’t have any caste or gender barrier. Your language and color makes no difference to us, as your race, tribe and nationality commands our absolute respect and sense of humor towards mankind, while the necessary differences which further represents the diversities and beauty of nature, motivates our diligence and unequivocal duty and responsibility to equal and free servitude to all living beings. 
                    Over the ages past, our dear planet has been bedeviled with hunger, food shortages and incessant perilous wars, underscored by abrogate intermittent disagreements in the global and national peace accord and treaties unabated. Humanity yet up to date still grope and wallow under the hopeless shadows and catastrophic mysteries of pestilences and miseries of natural disasters of different causes; the overlapping socio-political and economic meltdown coupled with practical encounters with heartless criminalities in the society, badly affecting every living system in the world without substantive solution and permanent remedy. This is not the will of the all merciful God for the human populace, but the result of ignorance about nature and the creator himself. In our possession are the first class information and techniques; yet, an indispensible yardstick for achieving global peace, security and tranquility at its minimal risk of 95% success guaranteed.  
                    From our knowledge of astronomy; the astral and the cosmic constellations and their planetary manipulative influences and energies, both on collective and individual earth life activities, this organization wants to stand up with head very tall and productively bold to present our world peace and conflict resolution formulae and expertise to the world leaders for global peace and security; the antidote to curb internal crisis and terrorism for possible adoption and implementation in the world society. Thus, the United Nations authorities and her multilateral and subsidiary agents and partnerships in the service must receive our invitation request as a matter of urgency to present this noble course. The European Union, E U, the Commonwealth of Nations and their likes in the world security apparatus and governing body; we must approach these opinion leaders with this confidential secrets from the timeless Puranas as means for social emancipation and escape route from the age-long humanitarian crisis and savagery on the earth planet.  
                    The world presently, needs to know this confidential secret of the Vedic version about true healthcare delivery and management, including our best stuff on food security, agriculture, and food sufficiency. And by the advantage and faculty of our in-depth knowledge of ecology and natural disaster management and control, we also want to tell the nations of the world the way out of environmental degradation; forestation and deforestation; climate change, global warming and remedy to the depletion of the ozone layers; to mention but few.
